        yana is a groundbreaking digital platform that will empower survivors of
        sexual assault with accurate and timely support information, a space to
        record what happened and critical checklists of reporting and justice
        procedures.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        We’re keen to talk to sexual assault charities and support organisations
        about how we can work together – particularly on yana’s support
        information. This is a priority for us – we want to make sure only
        quality, accurate information makes it onto the platform. Please get in
        touch with us so we can discuss how we can collaborate.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        Giving clarity and control when survivors need it the most, yana will be
        the world’s largest collaborative resource for survivors of sexual
        assault, launching initially in the UK and India.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        yana will offer signposting to local shelters – including those
        supporting marginalised communities – sexual violence units, lawyers,
        therapists, digital services and more. There will be information on
        procedures for reporting so that survivors know what to expect but also
        alerts them if proper procedure is not followed.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        Importantly, yana’s recording tool will provide a space for survivors to
        enter and save details of the incident. This can help a later
        investigation and save survivors the trouble of repeating details to
        multiple authorities.
