      <p class="body-1 mt-4">
        yana provides survivors of sexual assault with information and
        connections to support that they need to understand their experience and
        make informed decisions.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        Though information exists on what to do and where to go, it’s often
        fragmented and hard to navigate. Stigma, fear of being judged, and a
        lack of trust in institutions, especially among vulnerable groups, also
        contribute to survivors not coming forward.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        Co-created with survivors, yana brings together timely and accurate
        information in one safe and accessible place.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        yana’s recording tool provides a structured approach to logging details
        of the assault. This can significantly help a later investigation and
        may remove the need for survivors to repeat the same details to multiple
        authorities – something that we know can be traumatic. yana walks hand
        in hand with survivors through the reporting and justice process, and
        makes connections to support services.
      </p>

      <p class="body-1">
        In developing yana, survivors have been able to contribute to supporting
        others; something they have told us is an essential part of their
        recovery.
